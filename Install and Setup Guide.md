## How to Install Raspberry Pi OS on a Raspberry Pi

### Materials Required

- Raspberry Pi (any model, e.g., Raspberry Pi 4)
- Micro SD Card (at least 8 GB, but 16 GB or more is recommended)
- Micro SD Card Adapter (for inserting into your computer)
- Monitor (with HDMI input)
- HDMI Cable (Micro HDMI for Raspberry Pi 4, standard HDMI for older models)
- USB Keyboard
- USB Mouse
- Power Supply for Raspberry Pi (official Raspberry Pi 5V/3A power adapter recommended)
- Computer (with internet access to download software)
- USB card reader (if your computer doesn’t have an SD card slot)

## Step 1: Download Raspberry Pi OS

Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) is the official operating system for Raspberry Pi. It’s lightweight and designed specifically for Raspberry Pi hardware.

### Download Raspberry Pi OS

1. Go to the official [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/).
2. Scroll down to the **Raspberry Pi OS** section.

There are multiple versions of Raspberry Pi OS available:

- **Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop**: Full desktop experience, comes with a GUI.
- **Raspberry Pi OS Lite**: Command-line interface (CLI) only, no desktop (useful for servers and lightweight setups).
- **Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop and Recommended Software**: Full version with extra software like programming tools, office apps, etc.

For beginners, it’s best to download **Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop**.

### Download Raspberry Pi Imager

1. Go to the official [Raspberry Pi Imager page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).
2. Click on the **Download for Windows**, **macOS**, or **Ubuntu** button depending on your computer’s operating system.
3. Once downloaded, install Raspberry Pi Imager on your computer.

## Step 2: Prepare the Micro SD Card

You need to write the Raspberry Pi OS image to your Micro SD card. The easiest way to do this is by using the **Raspberry Pi Imager** software you downloaded.

### Insert the Micro SD Card

1. Insert the **Micro SD card** into your computer’s SD card slot or use a **USB card reader**.
2. Use a **Micro SD card adapter** if your computer requires it.

### Use Raspberry Pi Imager to Write the OS

1. Open **Raspberry Pi Imager** on your computer.
2. In the Imager, follow these steps:
   - **Choose OS**: Click on this button and select the Raspberry Pi OS version you want to install (choose **Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop** for a graphical interface).
   - **Choose SD Card**: Select your SD card from the list (make sure you choose the correct device to avoid overwriting other drives).
   - **Write**: Click the **Write** button to start the process.

   The Raspberry Pi Imager will download the Raspberry Pi OS image and write it directly to your SD card. This process might take a few minutes.

### (Optional) Advanced Setup in Raspberry Pi Imager

If you want to preconfigure settings such as Wi-Fi or SSH before booting, you can use the advanced menu in Raspberry Pi Imager by pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + X`. Here you can:

- Enable **SSH access**
- Set up your **Wi-Fi SSID** and password
- Configure the **hostname**

## Step 3: Insert the Micro SD Card into the Raspberry Pi

1. Once Raspberry Pi Imager finishes writing the image, safely eject the **Micro SD card** from your computer.
2. Insert the **Micro SD card** into the microSD slot on the Raspberry Pi.

## Step 4: Connect the Hardware

- **Monitor**: Connect your monitor to the Raspberry Pi using the appropriate HDMI cable (Micro HDMI for Raspberry Pi 4).
- **Keyboard & Mouse**: Plug your USB keyboard and mouse into the Raspberry Pi’s USB ports.
- **Power Supply**: Connect the **Canakit Power Cable** (or any 5V/3A power supply) to your Raspberry Pi.

## Step 5: Boot the Raspberry Pi

When the Raspberry Pi is powered on, it will automatically boot from the SD card. On the first boot, the **Raspberry Pi OS Setup Wizard** will guide you through the initial setup:

- **Language and Region**: Select your preferred language, country, and timezone.
- **Wi-Fi Network**: If you didn’t configure Wi-Fi earlier, you’ll be prompted to connect to a network now.
- **Password**: Set a secure password for the `pi` user.
- **Software Update**: The wizard will check for updates and install them (this may take some time).

After completing the setup, you’ll be taken to the Raspberry Pi OS desktop.

## Step 6: (Optional) Enabling SSH for Remote Access

If you want to control your Raspberry Pi remotely (without a monitor or keyboard attached), you’ll need to enable SSH (Secure Shell).

### Enable SSH through Raspberry Pi Configuration

1. In Raspberry Pi OS, click on the **Raspberry Pi icon** (top-left corner) → **Preferences** → **Raspberry Pi Configuration**.
2. Go to the **Interfaces** tab and enable **SSH**.

You can now use SSH to remotely access your Raspberry Pi.

If you’ve set up SSH via the advanced menu in Raspberry Pi Imager, this will already be enabled.

## Step 7: Update Raspberry Pi OS

It’s always a good idea to update the software after installation to make sure everything is up to date.

1. Open a terminal (click the terminal icon on the desktop or press `CTRL + ALT + T`).
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```
